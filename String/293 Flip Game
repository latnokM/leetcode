You are playing the following Flip Game with your friend: Given a string that contains only these two characters: + and -, 
you and your friend take turns to flip two consecutive "++" into "--". The game ends when a person can no longer make a move 
and therefore the other person will be the winner.

Write a function to compute all possible states of the string after one valid move.

Example:

Input: s = "++++"
Output: 
[
  "--++",
  "+--+",
  "++--"
]
Note: If there is no valid move, return an empty list [].

class Solution {
public:
    vector<string> generatePossibleNextMoves(string s) {
        vector<string> res;
        for(int i = 1; i < s.size(); ++i) {
            string cur(s);   //to save space, change s and reset
            if(s[i] == '+' && s[i - 1] == '+') {
                cur.replace(i - 1, 2, "--");
                res.push_back(cur);
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
};
