Given a binary tree, find its minimum depth.

The minimum depth is the number of nodes along the shortest path from the root node down to the nearest leaf node.

Note: A leaf is a node with no children.

Example:

Given binary tree [3,9,20,null,null,15,7],

    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7
return its minimum depth = 2.

class Solution {
public:
    int minDepth(TreeNode* root) {
        //BFS
        if (!root) return 0;
        
        int depth = 0;
        queue<TreeNode*> q;
        q.push(root);
        while (!q.empty()) {
            int n = q.size(); //number of nodes in current depth
            depth++;
            for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
                TreeNode *cur = q.front();
                q.pop();
                if (!cur->left && !cur->right) return depth;
                if (cur->left) q.push(cur->left);
                if (cur->right) q.push(cur->right);
            }
        }
        return depth;
    }
};
